# IS237Final
Maze game final project

basically, a maze game that randomely generates a maze that you need to escape out of in order to move to the next level
We used pygame and the random plugin to create a fun everchanging maze game where the goal is to escape to the outer edges of the maze
To play just run the program and use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player character, and hit space in order to stop moving
